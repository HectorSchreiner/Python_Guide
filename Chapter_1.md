# 1.0 What is Python
Python is a high-level programming language. Here the term *high-level* refers to the language being focused on readability, simplicity and ease of use. This is in contrast to other programming languages such as Rust, C, Assembly and many more.
A high-level programming language is for the most parts "easier" to use than low-level languages.

But it often comes with a cost of performance.\
Performance is a term that descibres how fast a program can run. Fx: a game written in python might run at 60fps but a game written in C might run at 120fps (these are totally arbitrary and made up numbers).
