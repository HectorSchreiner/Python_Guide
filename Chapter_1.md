This is a guide written for people completely new to programming.

# 1.0 What is Python
Python is a high-level programming language. Here the term *high-level* refers to the language being focused on readability, simplicity and ease of use. This is in contrast to other programming languages such as Rust, C, Assembly and many more.
A high-level programming language is for the most parts "easier" to use than low-level languages.

But it often comes with a cost of performance.\
Performance is a term that descibres how fast a program can run. Fx: a game written in python might run at 60fps but a game written in C might run at 120fps (these are totally arbitrary and made up numbers).

# 1.1 Downloading Python?
How do we run this python code you might ask? and for this, we need to things. First we need a **code editor**! A code editor is also called an IDE (Integrated Development Enviroment), Technically they are not exactly the same, and the difference is mostly that an IDE holds a bunch of extra features, specifically for writing code, such as debugging, code highlighting, and a bunch of other advanced features we wont be needing right now. So for now, think of the two as the same thing.

Back to where i was... A code editor is just a text editor, and you can actually use any program that can write text, to write your python programs. Fx. you can use notepad, notepad++, visual studio code, pycharm, neovim, Sublime and even word (pls dont use word). There are also multiple online editors fx. [online-python.com](https://www.online-python.com/).

You can choose whatever you want, but for now we will use the online editor mentioned [above](https://www.online-python.com/).

If you want to use a local text editor such as vscode or notepad, you also need to install your own python compiler, see the installation steps for this [Here](Here)
